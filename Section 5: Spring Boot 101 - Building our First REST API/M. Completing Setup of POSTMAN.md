# 🖊️ Completing Setup of POSTMAN

---

## Why this setup was needed 🤔

Till now:

* I **installed Postman**
* I **called GET & POST APIs**
* Everything was working ✅

But problem I noticed 👇
👉 All my requests were only in **History**

That means:

* If I close Postman ❌
* If I uninstall Postman ❌
* If system crashes ❌

➡️ **All requests are gone**

So I need a way to **save API requests permanently**.

---

## Problem with History tab 🕒

History tab:

* Shows requests I ran
* But ❌ **not saved**
* ❌ Not organized
* ❌ Can be lost anytime

So history is **temporary memory**, not storage.

---

## Solution: COLLECTIONS 📁

Postman gives a feature called **Collections**.

### What is a Collection? (simple meaning)

Collection = **folder of API requests**

Example:

* One app → many APIs
* Save all APIs in **one collection**

Like:

```text
Hello World App (Collection)
 ├── GET /hello
 ├── POST /hello
```

So later:

* I don’t need to recreate APIs
* I can reuse anytime

---

## Why I couldn’t save before ❌

Before login:

* “Save” button was disabled
* “Add to collection” not usable

👉 To use collections, **Postman account is required**

---

## Creating Postman account 👤

What I did:

1. Click **Sign in / Create account**
2. Options:

   * Email
   * Google login
3. I used **Google sign-in**
4. Accepted license
5. Postman opened again (logged in)

After login:
✅ Save button enabled
✅ Collections tab visible
✅ Environment tab visible

---

## New UI after login 🧠

After signing in, I saw new sections:

Left side panel now has:

* History
* **Collections**
* Environments

So Postman becomes more powerful after login.

---

## Saving a request to Collection 💾

Steps I followed:

1. Go to **History**
2. Click any request (GET / POST)
3. Click **Save**
4. Postman asks:

   * Where to save?

---

## Creating my first Collection 📁

Since I had no collection:

1. Click **Create Collection**
2. Give name:

   ```
   Hello World App
   ```
3. Click **Create**
4. Click **Save**

Now:

* Request is saved permanently
* No fear of losing it

---

## Saving multiple requests 🧩

I saved:

* POST `/hello`
* GET `/hello`

Both inside same collection.

So now structure looks like:

```text
Collections
 └── Hello World App
      ├── GET /hello
      └── POST /hello
```

---

## What I can do with saved requests 🔧

Once request is in collection, I can:

* Open it anytime
* Modify URL / body
* Save again
* Duplicate it
* Reuse for testing
* Share with others

No need to:
❌ Rewrite JSON
❌ Rewrite URL
❌ Remember request details

---

## Why collections are VERY useful 🧠

Real projects:

* 10s or 100s of APIs
* Login APIs
* User APIs
* Order APIs

Collections help:

* Organize APIs by app
* Save time
* Avoid mistakes
* Professional workflow

---

## Visual idea (Postman organization) 📊

```text
Postman
 ├── History (temporary)
 └── Collections (permanent)
       ├── Hello World App
       │     ├── GET /hello
       │     └── POST /hello
       └── Job Application APIs
             ├── POST /login
             └── GET /profile
```

---

## Important beginner reminder ⚠️

If I:

* Don’t sign in
* Don’t save requests

Then:
👉 Everything is lost later
👉 I’ll have to recreate APIs again

Saving = **good habit**

---

## What I learned from this video 🎯

* History ≠ Saved
* Collections = permanent storage
* Login is required for saving
* Collections help organize APIs
* Very useful for real projects & interviews

## 🧠 One-Line Strong Recall (exact recall style)

> **Postman collections allow us to permanently save and organize API requests, preventing loss of work and enabling easy reuse, unlike the temporary History tab.**
